    <!--this page uses UTF-8 to store and read characters (mandatory). The Unicode Standard is like a master list of all characters of all languages and assigns each character a unique number (ex. A = U+0041). UTF-8 then encodes that unique number into bytes (U+0041 -> 01000001 - 1 byte = 8 bits). The browser reads these 1s and 0s and knows to intpret them using UTF-8 decoding rules, bringing them back from bytes into readable characters-->

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

    <!--Linking corresponding external index.css to HTML page
    link rel="stylesheet" defines relationship between linked file and current HTML document (only used if href attribute is present)
    href attribute specifices the destination of the link, needs to be in the same folder
    Understanding Path Symbols is very important: ./ refers to the current directory (the folder that the current file is in)
    ../ means one level up from the current folder
    ../../ means two levels up from the current folder
    foldername/filename means go to the the subfolder "foldername" and retrieve filename-->
